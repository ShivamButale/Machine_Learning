on kaggle it was also specified how important the features were. 
only living area had importance of 0.2 ..rest all had 0.01 and so on.... so i neglected them..
also in a general view only area affects the price of a house.


But u can also calculate  price using multiple parameters using multiple regression..


Also 1 more important thing. i have specified data to test myself in the code ...
Instead read the data from the datasset ..using the command : rushikesh_data = pd.read_csv ("Filename.csv")

Separate the columns into features and target variable 


features = data["name of feautrecolumn1(eg.location)", "featurecol2(eg.sqft)"]

targetvarible = data["name of output column"]

Split the data into train and test 

RUN !!

sending 2 datasets :
1)house_data : Dataset from kaggle
2)house_data_edited  : Contains only sqft  and price 

Recommended that u find price based on all parametres (That will be much impressive!!)
Finding only on basis of sqft area is ok but not that impressive !
